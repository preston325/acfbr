I want to build and app will be called "Americas College Football Rankings".
The app's purpose is to have Americas football pundits (i.e. podcasters) cast votes each week based on their opinions, observations, and experience. This will be completely independant of ESPN and the college playoff committee because they suck.

I intend to build a mobile-app and a web-app to interact with notable podcasters who do commentary on college football.

The app will be a mobile-first app that uses React Native (mobile) + Next.js (web/public pages).

The following pages will be necessary: 
    landing page:
        landing page will descrip 
    registration page, 
    signin page, 
    ballot casting page,
    public page to display top 25 ranked team in the database according to votes cast by registered users, 

A Postgress Database will be required to manage user registration, user signins, ballott casting

I will need use of the balldontlie NCAAF api to get current rankings for comparison.
