I want to build and app will be called "Americas College Football Rankings".
The app's purpose is to have Americas football pundits (i.e. podcasters) cast votes each week based on their opinions, observations, and experience. This will be completely independant of ESPN and the college playoff committee because they suck.

I intend to build a mobile-app and a web-app to interact with notable podcasters who do commentary on college football.

The app will be a mobile-first app that uses React Native (mobile) + Next.js (web/public pages).

The following pages will be necessary: 
    landing page: this will be the description and purpose of our app with signin and registration links.
    registration page: seperate page that has a web-form to gather user's Name, Email, Password, and Password confirmation.
    signin page: separate page with 2 field web form to authenticate user's Email and Password combo 
    ballot casting page: This page is located behind the login page with a log of each college football team than can be dragged into a ranking "slot" based on the opinion of the logged in user.
    Ranking page public page to display top 25 ranked team in the database according to votes cast by registered users. 

A Postgress Database will be required to manage user registration, user signins, ballott casting

I will need use of the balldontlie NCAAF api to get current rankings for comparison.

This needs to be a docker container solution with one container for the app and one for the postgress database.


docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
